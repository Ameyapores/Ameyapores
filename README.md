<!--
**Ameyapores/Ameyapores** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

Thanks for visiting my Github page. Checkout my projects here based for application of Deep reinforcement learning for robotic control.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning information theoretic approaches for learning generalisable representations.
- ğŸ‘¯ If you have great ideas on learning representations in a reinforcement learning setting, hit me up on the details below.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about surgical robotics, I'd be happy to direct you to relevant literature.
